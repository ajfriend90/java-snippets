# Java Snippets

A collection of small Java programs and methods that Iâ€™m building as I learn and practice the language. This repo is meant to track my daily progress, experiments, and patterns I find useful.

## ðŸ§  Snippets
- `MatrixMultiplication.java`: Multiply a 1xN matrix by an NxN matrix to get a 1xN result. 

- `NthFibonacci.java`: Calculate the Nth Fibonacci number using Matrix Exponentiation. I didn't author this, just saving it for fun.

- `ArrayBubbleSort.java`: Sort a given array in descending order using bubble sort algorithm. 

- `LeapYear.java`: Enter a year and find out if it's a leap year. 

- `CalculateCoinsGivenChange.java`: Calculates the fewest of each type of coin to make up a total change in cents. 

- `PlantClassLab.java`: Take in input for plant/flower until terminal input and then print report.

More to come.
