# Java Snippets

A collection of small Java programs and methods that Iâ€™m building as I learn and practice the language. This repo is meant to track my daily progress, experiments, and patterns I find useful.

## ðŸ§  Snippets
- `MatrixMultiplication.java`: Multiply a 1xN matrix by an NxN matrix to get a 1xN result. Proud of this one â€” had to carefully reason through indexing.

- `NthFibonacci.java`: Calculate the Nth Fibonacci number using Matrix Exponentiation. I didn't author this, just saving it for fun.

- `ArrayBubbleSort.java`: Sort a given array in descending order using bubble sort algorithm. Came up with this one for a class lab. Looked up bubble sort algorithm pseudocode on Wiki and implemented it into Java. 

-`LeapYear.java`: Enter a year and find out if it's a leap year. This is a common problem in many class labs, so I figured it might be useful to save the logic that calculates leap years to look back on.

-`CalculateCoinsGivenChange.java`: Calculates the fewest of each type of coin to make up a total change in cents. Another problem that comes up often in class labs that I figured I'd save for future reference.

More to come.
